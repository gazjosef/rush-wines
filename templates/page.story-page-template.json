Having had the<br\/>opportunity to work with some great winemakers over the last seven years, both<br\/>here in Australia (Hunter Valley and Tasmania, both the Tamar and the Derwent)<br\/>and in the USA, I’ve learnt many different methods and seen the benefits of<br\/>certain techniques. While adopting some of these and incorporating my own<br\/>ideas, I was able to identify the types of wines that I was interested in making<br\/>and that I would be proud to put my name to as examples of balanced<br\/>winemaking. Wine for me is something tangible, something for people to enjoy.<br\/>I’m not artistic, but making wine seems to be a combination of science and art<br\/>which suits my background in forensic chemistry.<\/p>"
